  "summary": "Diff adds production env config (VITE_APP_ENV=Live), updates frontend environment detection logic, and introduces a deployment preflight doc + script. It does not show any concrete fix to the underlying production deployment failure beyond these frontend/build-time checks, and it includes unrelated repo metadata updates.",

      "requirement": "Investigate the current “Failed to deploy to production: Deployment error” for Version 22 and apply the minimal code/config changes required so the project can successfully deploy to the Live (production) environment.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include any changes to deployment configuration (e.g., dfx.json, CI/CD configs) or backend build/deploy logic, nor does it show the specific root-cause fix for the production deployment error; only frontend env handling and a preflight script are added.",
