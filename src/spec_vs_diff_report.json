  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented via updates to publish-live documentation and publish-live.sh console messaging to reference Version 25 and keep the target domain radicaleconomist101-h78.caffeine.xyz. REQ-1 is partially supported by publish-live.sh running the preflight script and deploying the frontend canister, but the diff does not provide evidence that the Live UI will indicate the environment is Live after publish. The diff also includes unrelated project bookkeeping updates and a broad set of UI/app feature descriptions not requested for a publish-only task.",

      "reason": "The diff shows deployment scripts and documentation updates, but does not show any concrete frontend code/config change ensuring the deployed Live site will indicate 'Live' in the UI (only a script note telling the operator to verify this).",
