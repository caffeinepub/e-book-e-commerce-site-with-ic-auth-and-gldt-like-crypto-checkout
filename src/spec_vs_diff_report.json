      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Publish workflow blocks immediately if frontend/VERSION is not exactly '29'.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new/updated enforcement scripts, but does not show the actual content of frontend/VERSION or any change confirming it contains exactly '29'. The requirement explicitly constrains that file content, and the diff summary does not include it.",

      "reason": "frontend/scripts/publish-live.sh is truncated before the actual deployment command is shown, so the diff summary does not provide evidence that it runs exactly `dfx deploy frontend --network ic` (and only that).",
