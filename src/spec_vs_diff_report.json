  "summary": "The diff implements a documented, frontend-only rollback-to-v35 workflow (docs + scripts), preserves Live publish guardrails via strict Version 29 enforcement while adding a separate rollback/testing path, and fixes the Draft v36 catalog regression by switching Catalog to use `useGetAllBooks()` plus explicit user-visible error rendering. A minimal manual regression checklist document is also added. However, the request mentions catalog/library UI; only the Catalog page change is evidenced in the diff. The diff also includes unrequested UI/footer marketing/support additions.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Fix the regression that prevents previously uploaded books from being visible in the catalog/library UI (not just catalog).",
      "reason": "The diff shows a fix on `frontend/src/pages/CatalogPage.tsx` (switch to `useGetAllBooks()` and add error UI), but provides no evidence of any corresponding fix in the Library/MyLibrary UI components/pages. Since the requirement explicitly calls out catalog/library UI, coverage for the library side is not evidenced.",
